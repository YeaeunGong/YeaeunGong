Hi, I am a MS student in Cognitive Science at Seoul National University. As you can see [Here(publication)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sIXOhAQAAAAJ&hl=ko/), I am interested in various fields ranging from learning analytics to HCI and therefore published papers with diverse topics. As a research methodology, I prefer to use a mixed methodology from big data analysis to qualitative analysis and experimentation. Recently, my research interests lies in helping experts and people make better decisions, *i.e., incresing the transparency of machine learning algorithms that support human decision making.* I am currently narrowing down the research topic of interest more deeply.

When I'm not doing research, I occasionally listen to music, watch youtube and walk with my puppy, ggomuli. Below is the picture of me(right) and ggomuli, with my best friend Bomi Kim(left) holding my master's thesis.
